# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
This analysis is for V.Isualize, who is the CEO of PyBer, a Python based ride sharing app company. This analysis consists of the following:
* A summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.
* A multiple line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results
### The Summary DataFrame

### Differences in Ride-Sharing Data Amongst Different City Types
* In rural cities, there are significantly less drivers, which directly affects the cost of both the average fare per ride and driver. 
  * The average fare per driver in rural cities is over three times higher than urban cities.
  * The average fare per driver in rural cities is approximately 40% higher than suburban cities.
  * The average fare per ride is in rual cities is approximately four dollars higher than suburban cities.
  * The average fare per ride is in rual cities is approximately ten dollars higher than urban cities.
* Urban cities have over thirty times the amount of total drivers than rural cities, and almost five times as many total drivers than suburban cities.
* The total rides for each city type is much higher in urban cities compared to the other two city types:
  * Over two and a half times higher than suburban cities.
  * Thirteen times higher than rural cities
* The total fares by city type follow the same path as total rides and drivers; significantly higher in uban cities:
  * Urban cities have approximately two times as many total fares compared to suburban cities.
  * Urban cities have approximately nine times as many total fares compared to rural cities.

## Summary
Based on this analysis, I have three business recommendations for V.Isualize
* In rural cities, I recommend lowering the average fare per driver by up to %50 as well as lowering the average fare per ride by up to %20. By doing so, this will entice more customers and also allow for an increase in total drivers. By increasing the amount of customers and drivers this should increase your total fares.
* In suburban cities, I recommend lowering the average fare per driver by up to %30 as well as lowering the average fare per ride by up to %10. Doing so will allow you to hire more drivers and entice more customers. These two combined will increase your total fares in suburban cities.
* In urban cities, I recommend offering new customers a %50 discount on their first 2 rides. Also, offer a rewards program for repeat customers such as a free ride after 10 rides and free ride on birthdays. Lastly, I recommend offering an incentive program for the drivers that will pay them bonuses for completing a set amount of total rides per day and week. These three combined will increase your total fares.
